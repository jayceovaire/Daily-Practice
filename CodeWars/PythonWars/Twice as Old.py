# Your function takes two arguments:
# current father's age (years)
# current age of his son (years)
# Ð¡alculate how many years ago the father was twice as old as his son
# (or in how many years he will be twice as old).
# The answer is always greater or equal to 0, no matter if it was in the past or it is in the future.
