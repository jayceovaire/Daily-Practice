// Fundamental idea of an array - contiguous memory space - contains certain amount of bytes
// Arrays can have memory space allocated at will. example: 8bit or 16bit memory spacing.
// fixed in size - cannot simply grow an array
// Big O of getting a value out of an array O(1)
// GET, INSERT, DELETE all O(1) on arrays.

 const a = [] //is not an array
